# üì° WiFi Scanner Pro

**WiFi Scanner Pro** is an Android application built using **Jetpack Compose** and **Room**. It scans for nearby WiFi networks, records signal strength (RSSI), and associates the data with geolocation information. Users can select predefined locations, view scan results in both list and matrix formats, and review logs of past scans.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **WiFi Scanning**  
  Automatically scans for nearby WiFi networks and records:
  - SSID
  - BSSID
  - RSSI (signal strength)

- **Location Integration**  
  Associates each scan with:
  - Latitude and longitude
  - Geocoded address (using GPS or predefined coordinates)

- **Location Selection**  
  Choose between:
  - **Location A:** Current device location  
  - **Location B & C:** Offset by ~110 meters

- **Data Persistence**  
  Stores scan results and network details in a **Room** database with migration support.

- **UI Views**
  - **List View:** Expandable cards with network details
  - **Matrix View:** Grid showing RSSI values for each scan
  - **Logs Dialog:** Review all past scan data

- **Auto-Scanning**  
  Scans every 6 seconds (respects Android's scan throttling limitations).

- **Permissions Handling**  
  Manages runtime permissions for location and WiFi access.

## üì± Requirements

- Android API Level **21 (Lollipop)** or higher
- Required Permissions:
  - `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: For GPS and scanning
  - `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`: For WiFi scan results
- WiFi must be enabled on the device

## üìù Notes

- **Scan Throttling:** Android enforces a ~4-6 second delay between scans.
- **Geocoder Fallback:** If geocoding fails, address is marked as `"Unknown location"`.
- **Permission Prompts:** Scanning is disabled unless all required permissions are granted.
- **Migrations:** Supports Room migration from version 1 to 2, adding `wifi_networks` table and location fields.
